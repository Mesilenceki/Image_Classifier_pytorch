# Image_Classifier_pytorch
* This is a Deep learning project in Data Science NanoDegree that used pytorch to build a neural network to classify the flowers. Besides , we also write a command line application to use the previous program to use transfer learning and pytorch train a new classifier on top of a pre-existing model trained on ImageNet to identify between 102 different types of flowers.

## Require libries
python pytorch matplotlib scipy numpy 
* Run train.py to train the classifier
* Run predict.py to use the checkpoint file created by train.py
